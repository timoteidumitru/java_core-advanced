ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) – Theory & Use Cases

Feature                                              Description
⚡ Ultra-low latency GC                                Pause times typically under 1 millisecond, regardless of heap size.
🧩 Concurrent compaction                              Performs marking, relocation, and cleanup concurrently with application threads.
🏗️ Scalable design                                    Handles multi-terabyte heaps efficiently without long stop-the-world pauses.
🧠 Colored pointers                                   Uses pointer metadata to track object states with minimal synchronization.
🚀 Modern memory model                                Continuously reclaims unused memory and can return it to the OS.


Real-World Scenario                                  Why ZGC Works Well
🏦 Real-time financial trading                        Predictable response times with minimal GC interference.
🧮 Machine learning & analytics                       Processes large datasets in memory with low-latency GC.
🎮 Gaming & streaming apps                            Ensures consistent frame rates and responsiveness.
🌐 High-throughput APIs & microservices               Ideal for large-scale, low-latency distributed systems.
📊 Event-driven systems                               Smooth operation under heavy and dynamic memory load.


Option                                               Purpose
-XX:+UseZGC                                           Enables the Z Garbage Collector.
-XX:SoftMaxHeapSize=<size>                            Sets preferred soft heap limit for dynamic memory control.
-XX:+ZUncommit                                        Allows unused memory to be returned to the OS.
-Xms / -Xmx                                           Set initial and maximum heap size.
-Xlog:gc*                                             View GC activity (Java 9+).

Run Command:
java -XX:+UseZGC `
     -Xms25g -Xmx25g `
     -XX:SoftMaxHeapSize=25g `
     -XX:+ZUncommit `
     -Xlog:gc*,gc+stats=trace:file=src/main/resources/IO_operations/gc-perf.log `
     -cp target\classes `

Summary:
ZGC is ideal for large-scale, low-latency applications that demand predictable performance under high memory load.
It achieves this through concurrent marking, relocation, and remapping phases, ensuring that the Java application
threads continue executing with minimal interruption.
