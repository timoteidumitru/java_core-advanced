Serial GC – Theory & Use Cases

Feature                                                 Description
🧵 Single-threaded GC                                   Uses only one thread to perform garbage collection (both minor and major collections).
🧮 Stop-the-world events                                Completely pauses all application threads during garbage collection cycles.
⚙️ Simple design                                        Ideal for small applications and single-core systems; minimal overhead.
🚀 Predictable behavior                                 Easy to understand and debug; each GC event happens sequentially.
🧠 Default in small-memory JVMs                         Automatically chosen by JVM for low-memory or single-core environments.


Real-World Scenario                                     Why Serial GC Works Well
🧩 Desktop or GUI apps                                  Small heap sizes, typically single-user, where GC pauses aren’t noticeable.
🧪 Testing or educational purposes                      Perfect for understanding GC behavior in a simple, single-threaded context.
🧮 Microservices with small heaps                       Low memory footprint and minimal thread management overhead.
📊 Batch jobs or scripts                                When simplicity is more important than performance scalability.


Option                                                  Purpose
-XX:+UseSerialGC                                        Enables the Serial Garbage Collector (single-threaded).
-Xms / -Xmx                                             Sets initial and maximum heap size.
-Xlog:gc*                                               Enables detailed GC logging (Java 9+).

Run Command:
