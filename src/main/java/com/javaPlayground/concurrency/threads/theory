🔥 1. Thread Lifecycle

A thread has 5 main states:
    * New — created but not started
    * Runnable — ready or running
    * Blocked — waiting for monitor lock
    * Waiting / Timed Waiting — wait(), sleep(), or join()
    * Terminated — finished execution


🧨 2. Common Mistakes

    * Calling wait/notify outside synchronized → IllegalMonitorStateException
    * Using if instead of while → breaks on spurious wakeups
    * Using notify() instead of notifyAll() → potential deadlocks in multi-consumer or multi-producer systems
    * Holding locks too long → thread starvation
    * Forgetting that notify does NOT release lock → confusion / unexpected delays


🧠 3. Java Memory Model (JMM)

The Java Memory Model defines how threads interact through memory, including:
   * What a thread is allowed to see from other threads
   * When writes become visible
   * Which operations are atomic
   * What reordering the JVM is allowed to do
   * What the volatile keyword actually means
   * Why correct thread-safety requires happens-before relationships
