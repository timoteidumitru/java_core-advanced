🔥 1. Thread Lifecycle

A thread has 5 main states:
    * New — created but not started
    * Runnable — ready or running
    * Blocked — waiting for monitor lock
    * Waiting / Timed Waiting — wait(), sleep(), or join()
    * Terminated — finished execution


🧨 2. Common Mistakes

    * Calling wait/notify outside synchronized → IllegalMonitorStateException
    * Using if instead of while → breaks on spurious wakeups
    * Using notify() instead of notifyAll() → potential deadlocks in multi-consumer or multi-producer systems
    * Holding locks too long → thread starvation
    * Forgetting that notify does NOT release lock → confusion / unexpected delays


🧠 3. Java Memory Model (JMM) (Mental Model)

      Concept                   What it Solves
    * volatile                  Visibility + Prevents Reordering
    * synchronized              Atomicity + Visibility + ordering
    * happens-before            Rules guaranteeing visibility
    * atomic operations	        Indivisible operations
    * JMM                       Defines all allowed interactions between threads
