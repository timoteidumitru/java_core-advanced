Advanced Locks — ReadWriteLock vs StampedLock

    ReadWriteLock (ReentrantReadWriteLock)
        Strengths:
           * Multiple readers can proceed concurrently.
           * Writers get exclusive access.
           * Good for read-heavy workloads.

        Weakness:
           * Writers block all readers.
           * Reader starvation possible.

        Ideal Use Case:
           * Caches, configuration maps, product catalogs, reading 90%+, writing <10%.

    StampedLock
        Strengths:
           * Optimistic reads are extremely fast (no locking if no writer interferes).
           * Supports read lock, write lock, and optimistic read.
           * Great for highly read-dominated data structures.

        Weakness:
           * Not reentrant.
           * Requires manual validation of stamps.
           * Easy to misuse; deadlocks if not unlocking.

        Ideal Use Case:
           * Real-time analytics, geolocation services, monitoring dashboards, low-contention systems.

    Scientific Summary:
       * ReentrantReadWriteLock → safer, simpler, predictable performance.
       * StampedLock → fastest for optimistic-read-heavy workloads; unsafe if misused.
       * If readers dominate and data is mostly stable → choose StampedLock.
       * If balance between simplicity and concurrency matters → choose ReadWriteLock.
